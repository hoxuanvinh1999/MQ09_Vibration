To calculate the transfer function H_nm associated with each mode (n,m), we can use the formula:

H_nm = F_nm / (rho * k_nm * A_nm * omega**2 - T)

where:

F_nm, rho, k_nm, and A_nm are as defined in the previous question
omega is the angular frequency, which is given by omega = 2 * pi * f_e
To visualize the transfer function as an image, we can create a heatmap of the values of H_nm for different values of (n,m). Here is a Python script that implements this calculation and visualization:
